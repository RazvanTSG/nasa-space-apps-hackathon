# Data Strategy

## The Dataset
* **Source**: NASA Space Biology Publications.
* **Volume**: 608 full-text open-access papers.

## The Problem
Scientific papers are too dense for regular students to read. 

## The Solution
1. **Data Ingestion**: Clean text from 608 papers.
2. **Simplified Mapping**: Connecting related topics (e.g., Radiation -> DNA damage).
3. **Summarization**: Using AI to rewrite abstracts at an easy reading level. 
4. **Accuracy**: Cross-referencing AI summaries with original NASA sources.
