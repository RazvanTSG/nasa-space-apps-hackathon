# NASA Space Biology Search (2nd Place 🏆)  
**Event:** NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025  
**Challenge:** Space Biology Search Engine  
**Timeframe:** 48 Hours  
**Status:** Prototype (Ranked 2nd)  

### ⚡ What is this?
A search engine that translates complex NASA bioscience papers into simple terms using AI.
Built rapidly during a 2-day hackathon to solve the "data accessibility" problem for students.

### 👨‍💻 My Role: Team Lead & Architect
* **The challenge:** Integrate NASA's API with an LLM without hallucinations.
* **My fix:** Designed a "Strict Context" RAG system. The AI only answers from the 608 verified papers I scraped.
* **Management:** Led a team of 5 under extreme time pressure.

### 🧠 The Stack (AI + Engineering)
* **AI Tools:** Lovable (UI scaffolding), Google Gemini (Summarization).
* **Engineering:** Python/Flask (Backend), React/TypeScript (Frontend).
* **Data:** 608 Space Biology Publications (NASA OSDR).
