# 🚀 NASA Space Apps 2025 | Space Biology Search Engine
**Ranked 2nd Place** | Rapid Prototyping Sprint

## 🎯 The Goal
To help students access NASA bioscience research without getting lost in academic jargon or facing AI hallucinations.

## 🛠️ What We Built
A web platform that verifies and simplifies NASA data:
* **Explore Mode**: A gamified rocket interface to navigate scientific topics.
* **Smart Search**: Translates complex papers into 8th-grade reading level summaries.
* **Verified Chatbot**: An AI assistant restricted strictly to NASA datasets (no made-up facts).

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend**: Python, Flask
* **AI/NLP**: Google Gemini (for summarization)
* **Data**: NASA Open Science Data Repository (608 Publications)

## 👤 My Role
* **Team Leader**: Coordinated the 5-person team and managed the 48-hour timeline.
* **System Architect**: Designed the data flow between the NASA API and our simplification engine.
